# Templates

Some Google Drive templates for common documents applicable to all organizations. It is a good idea
to copy these into your own Drive and register them as templates.

- [Design Doc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v2oQiTGt6LTYV5foHx_ZcZm2i61DOGSfnX3G2XCyc08) - 
Design docs should be written before implementing any large engineering system or feature. It is a
good way to capture initial thoughts and motivations behind a system and is a good way to get
everyone on the same page before jumping into coding.

- [PRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B7nEwt3m_-P5v7Pq6bFwSistUsYiCvnnfLjWF1wjoNs) -
PRDs should be written by product managers before going into the technical design and implementation
of any medium-size or larger product feature. PRDs are a good place to get input from different
stakeholders and functions related to the product and iron out ambiguous points to ensure a smooth
development cycle.

- [Post-mortem](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vy1KzDVpDIM6Vyr39pzhZGyHHorsZzlex49bwl8idQc) -
Post-mortems are to reflect on unfortanate but inevitable times in product development, when there
is an incident that significantly impacts users or the development process. Post-mortems are an
opportunity to reflect, understand why an issue occurred, and create and execute on action items to
ensure the issue doesn't reoccur. Development teams will always have issues and make mistakes, so it
is important to reflect on them to not repeat mistakes. Action items always affect an entire
organization - post mortems are not for finding a single target to blame for an incident.
